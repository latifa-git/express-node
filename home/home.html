    <h6>Benefits of Reading Books: How It Can Positively Affect Your Life</h6>
    <p>
      A growing body of research indicates that reading literally changes your
      mind. Using MRI scans, researchers have confirmedTrusted Source that
      reading involves a complex network of circuits and signals in the brain.
      As your reading ability matures, those networks also get stronger and more
      sophisticated. In one studyTrusted Source conducted in 2013, researchers
      used functional MRI scans to measure the effect of reading a novel on the
      brain. Study participants read the novel “Pompeii” over a period of 9
      days. As tension built in the story, more and more areas of the brain lit
      up with activity.
